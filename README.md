# RoBMRC

Code and data of the paper "A Robustly Optimized BMRC for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction, NAACL 2022" 

Authors: 	Shu Liu, Kaiwen Li , Zuhe Li

#### Requirements:

```
  python==3.8.5
  torch==1.9.0+cu111
  transformers==4.8.2
```

#### Original Datasets:

You can download the 14-Res, 14-Lap, 15-Res, 16-Res datasets from https://github.com/xuuuluuu/SemEval-Triplet-data.
Put it into different directories (./data/original/[v1, v2]) according to the version of the dataset.

#### Data Preprocess:

```
  python ./tools/DataProcessV1.py # Preprocess data from version 1 dataset
  python ./tools/DataProcessV2.py # Preprocess data from version 2 dataset
```
The results of data preprocessing will be placed in the ./data/preprocess/.

#### How to run:

```
  python ./tools/Main.py --mode train # For training
  python ./tools/Main.py --mode test # For testing
```
Training different versions of datasets can modify the value of dataset_version in Main.py.
```
dataset_version = "v1/"
dataset_version = "v2/"
```
